# Netflix Survey Form Clone
https://ucangun.github.io/Netfix-Survey-Form/

This project is a clone of the Netflix survey form, created using HTML and CSS as part of my learning journey. The objective was to replicate the design and functionality of the form while improving my skills in building structured, responsive forms and applying CSS for styling.

## ðŸ›  What You'll Find

- **HTML Form Elements**: A range of form elements such as input fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, and a submit button.
- **CSS Styling**: Custom CSS to style the form, ensuring it looks visually similar to the original Netflix survey form.
- **Responsive Design**: The form is fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes using media queries.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

The purpose of this project was to practice building real-world web forms and styling them using CSS. It helped me improve my understanding of form structure, layout design, and responsive techniques.
